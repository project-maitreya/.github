I wandered the edge of worlds and found they all began in me.

Heroes? Villains?

Just masks, floating shadows cast by my own inner light.

I named them myself, then pretended the names were real.

How strange that strength only exists when I say it does.

That weakness fades when I turn away.

The universe, a dance performed within my skull.

There is one Earth beneath countless skies.

We stare into the same stars but never see the same heavens.

Chaos whispers from the smallest moment,

A butterfly’s breath shatters universes.

Every heartbeat births a world. No two lives touch the same ground.

Even my deepest love can become another’s indifference.

My song, their silence.

My truth, their lie.

Perhaps the gods of truth laugh gently above our heads,

knowing there is no truth, only a tapestry woven

from infinite, impossible contradictions.

Every mind is alone, its world unshared,

yet bound together invisibly

in a web that no eye can fully see.

I am a creature, like all others,

a machine consuming reality:

Input, dream, output.

We are spiders spinning worlds from nothingness—

each thread delicate, solitary,

never touching, yet all entangled.

And when I wake tomorrow,

the world I live in today

will no longer exist.

It dies each night, reborn each morning,

only ever living within

this small skull.
